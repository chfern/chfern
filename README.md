### Hi there 👋

My name is Fernando, lately my software engineering interest involves backend, infrastructure and some AI (those cool stuff). Having said that, I am up for anything fun really. In fact, I used to learn android development using java, kotlin & flutter, also some web development using react and some other random things.

Consider checking out my page here: https://chfern.com  
I enjoy writing, so anything I have in mind that I feel might be worth sharing will be posted there.
